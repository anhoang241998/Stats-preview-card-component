## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this project I learned how to use CSS Flexbox and grid together to achieve the required design.
- Moreover I also learned to use media queries for responsive web design.

```css
.img-container::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  -o-object-fit: cover;
  object-fit: cover;
  background-color: rgba(170, 92, 219, 0.6);
}
```

### Continued development

- Though I learned using media queries, but in the future, I will improve to make a good design for all screen sizes.
- Moreover, I will learn reactJS and bootstrap to make this design quickly and more beautiful.
